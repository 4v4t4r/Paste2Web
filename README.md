# Paste2Web - beta version
A python3 script that uses cl1p website to send and receive secret messages 
# Who does it work ?
-On sending it spliting the message to words then generates a **random word** and uses it in posting every word alone in a link and gives you a **key**

-Now to receive you should contact the person who you want him to receive your secret message and send him the **random word** and the **key** or he won't be able to receive your message

**Note:**

**1)The message would stay stored on the website till someone open it**

**2)No one could bruteforce the word or the key**

**3)The word and the key is regenerated every time you send a message.**

**4)There's no specific algorithim used to generate the word so no one could guess it**
